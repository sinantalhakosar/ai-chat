## üöÄ Deployed
Deployed on Vercel. Below are deployed links:
- [Main link](https://ai-chat-interface-sinan.vercel.app)
- [AI with tool calls](https://ai-chat-interface-git-tools-sinan-talha-kosars-projects.vercel.app/?_vercel_share=ocMKt7tWKS5dmGZEgmLvom2EuLZ9Md9K)

> [!NOTE]
> AI with tool calls link: There needs to be some hacky solutions made to get the tool calls to work, which breaks main flow. So I decided to have it on a different branch and link.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. Clone the repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Create a Supabase project and setup the `.env.local` file with your project's URL and ANON key.
3. Create public.charts and public.messages tables in your supabase project.
4. Add below RLS policies to your messages and charts tables:
```
Table: public.chats
    Policy: UPDATE
    Allow updates for authenticated users

    Policy: DELETE
    Enable delete for users based on user_id


    Policy: INSERT
    Enable insert for users based on user_id


    Policy: SELECT
    Enable users to view their own data only


Table: public.messages
    Policy: DELETE
    allow delete from all


    Policy: INSERT
    Enable insert for authenticated users only


    Policy: SELECT
    Enable read access for all users
```
5. Get a Gemini API key (free) and add it to your `.env.local` file (to summarize chat): (https://aistudio.google.com/app/u/1/apikey)
```
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=[INSERT GEMINI API KEY]
```
6. Run the app with `npm run dev`. The project should be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
